# TicTacToe-Python-Project
This is my first time working on something with python. Learning its basics and learning Tkinter alongside it 

This code is written me. It's not a masterpiece just yet but it gets the job done. a TicTacToe game as requested by my Python professor.
Have fun trying it out.
Any feedback is appreciated.
